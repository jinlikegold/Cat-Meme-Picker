# Cat Meme Picker

This project is from Scrimba's Frontend Career Path, Javascript Essentials module. 

While this was based a tutorial, I wrote each piece of code myself, as well as added an additional functionality that allows for the meme popup window to be closed via not only the "X" button on the popup, but also when clicking anywhere outside the popup itself. 

What I learned & practiced:
* the logical "not" operator
* the .filter() method for iterating through arrays
* importing/exporting data to a different file
* for of loops as a more efficient for loop
* the order of operations for writing & organizing functions
* working with checkbox inputs
* event targets
* expanded use of querySelector to target html elements other than id's and classes
* working with .classList to add and remove classes for styling
* working with parentElement
